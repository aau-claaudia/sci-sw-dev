## Project Description

Data for this project are from the European Court of Human Rights.(https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/)

The aim of this project was to use a script to automatically extract the IDs of each case and produce a plot of the distribution/count of different IDs in a sorted form.

### Configuration requirements
Requires python 3.8 or newer and R software version 4.2 or newer.

You can install R software from https://cloud.r-project.org

Also you should install tidyverse package in R console with command `install.packages("tidyverse")`

```

## Usage

In terminal

(1) `git clone https://github.com/Stwyb/sci-sw-dev.git`
